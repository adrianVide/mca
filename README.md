# MCA test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes

- The project will run in port 8080 after running `npm start`. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.
- `npm test` will run a RTL based test suite
- `npx cypress open` will run Cypress, then you can select E2E and run tests for each component

Adding 2 different test suites was needed as I couldn't do it with just RTL for the dragging of the bullets
